## Iga. A dead simple Auto-GPT capable of self-improvement.

This script starts a CLI chat with an Auto-GPT agent Iga who response with one of three actions, alongside their rationale:
- Talking to the user: This allows you to respond
- Running shell commands: These run in it's own directory. The output is returned to them.
- Thinking: This simple triggers another resposnse.

This hopefully provides you with an easy to understand platform that allows you to guide Iga in updating it's own source code and system instructions.
