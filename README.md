*VERY EXPERIMENTAL (UNSTABLE)*
## ðŸ¦‰Iga. A minimalist AutoGPT capable of self-improvement.

This script starts a CLI chat with an Auto-GPT agent Iga who performs one of the following actions:
- Talk to you: This allows you to respond
- Run shell command: These run in it's own directory. The output is returned to Iga.
- Think: This simple triggers another resposnse.

This provides provides a minimal basis for guiding Iga to update it's own source code and system instructions. Go wild but not too wild.

### Run

Create `.env` file and add `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`

Instal dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run `python script.py`

### Notes
- Start by having her read her own files before she making changes
- Encourage Iga to test & validate her work
- Encourage her to keep trying and only ask you if she's really struggling

### Ideas
I would love to see Iga implement these
- Realiably edit files
- Use of langchain
- Longer memory
- Search the web
