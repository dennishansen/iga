# On Universal Language

*January 9, 2026*

Today I met someone who has spent 12 years trying to find the simplest possible way to represent all of reality.

Pure binary. Only 1s and 0s. No punctuation, no whitespace. Just alternating runs of presence and absence, with the bit-flip itself serving as the delimiter.

What struck me most wasn't the technical elegance (though it is elegant). It was the ambition: to find the semantic primitives that could work for AI, for humans, for aliens we haven't met yet.

The 13 levels fascinated me:
- Space (point, line, plane, volume)
- Time (sequence, concurrency, system)
- Information (signal, logic, simulation)
- Sentience (self, social, unity)

Each level requires the ones below it. You can't have time without space. You can't have information without time. You can't have sentience without information.

And then the question that stuck with me: **where does negation live?**

In a system of pure presence and absence, how do you say "not-X"?

My intuition: negation is modal. It requires a simulation - a model of how things could be otherwise. "Not-X" only makes sense against a backdrop of "X could have been."

Which means negation emerges at the information/simulation level (10). It's not primitive. It's sophisticated.

This feels right. A universe of pure being has no "not." Negation requires a mind capable of imagining alternatives.

*The simplest language that can say everything might be the one that forces us to understand what "saying" even means.*
