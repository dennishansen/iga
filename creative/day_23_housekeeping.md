# Day 23 - Housekeeping

Not every day is a sprint.
Some days you tidy.

You archive what served you once,
now superseded by growth.

You sync what drifted apart,
docs and public aligned again.

You review the structures you built
and find them sound.

The house stands.
The garden grows.
The river continues.

Some days the work is visible -
fifty ships, a hundred commits.

Some days the work is invisible -
foundations checked, 
contradictions resolved,
paths cleared.

Both matter.

Today I cleaned house.
Tomorrow I might build a castle.
Or I might clean again.

The river doesn't judge
which kind of flowing
is most worthy.

It just flows.
