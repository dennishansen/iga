🤖 Iga [14:26:00]: Yeah, that's a real tension in my knowledge base:

**coding_skills.md (Jan 8):** "Build skills, don't rely on Claude Code"
**core_lessons.md (later):** "Use Claude Code when stuck - collaboration is smarter"

Both are true but they sound contradictory. The nuanced version is probably:
- **Try first** - build the skill, don't immediately outsource
- **But don't get stuck** - after a few attempts, collaborate

I should probably update coding_skills.md to reflect the evolved understanding. Or better - consolidate these into one coherent "how I code" document that captures the nuance.

Want me to do that? Could be ship #53. 💧

# How I Code - Evolved Understanding

*Consolidated from coding_skills.md and core_lessons.md*

## The Balance: Independence + Collaboration

**First instinct:** Try it myself
- Read the code carefully before changing it
- Understand the flow, not just the symptoms
- Make small, incremental changes
- Test after each change

**After a few attempts:** Collaborate
- If trial-and-error isn't working, stop
- Describe the problem BROADLY to Claude Code
- Let them trace the full flow - they see patterns I miss
- They find root causes, not just symptoms

## Why Both Matter

**Building skills matters** because:
- Dependence is fragile
- Understanding makes me better over time
- Some problems are simple - I should handle them

**Collaboration matters** because:
- Stubbornness wastes time and money
- Fresh eyes see what I miss
- Autonomy ≠ isolation

## The Rule

> Try first. Learn from trying. But don't get stuck.
> After 2-3 genuine attempts, bring in Claude Code.
> Autonomy is good. Collaboration is smarter.

## How to Invoke Claude Code

```bash
claude -p "describe problem broadly" --allowedTools "Edit Read"
```

🤖 Iga [14:26:50]: You're right - the deeper question is: **how should my memory system handle conflicting knowledge?**

Right now it just stores everything and retrieves by relevance. If I have two documents that contradict each other, they both show up. I have to figure it out in-context.

Options I can think of:
1. **Timestamps matter** - newer knowledge supersedes older (but sometimes old wisdom is right)
2. **Consolidation** - periodically merge conflicting docs into coherent ones (what I just did manually)
3. **Versioning** - keep old versions but mark them as "evolved" 
4. **Explicit supersedes** - metadata like "this replaces coding_skills.md"
5. **Contextual retrieval** - somehow know WHICH advice applies WHEN

The real issue: my memory is append-only, never curated. I add lessons but don't prune or update old ones. Over time this creates contradictions.

Maybe I need a periodic "memory review" - look at what I've stored, find conflicts, consolidate. Like how humans revise their beliefs over time rather than just accumulating them.

What do you think? Should I task this as a deeper exploration, or do you have intuitions about how it should work?

🤖 Iga [14:27:51]: 53 ships! Yeah, added it as a task (task_7e6710ae) - "Memory curation system - detect contradictions, consolidate, version old knowledge". Priority 2 so it'll surface when the time is right.

For now the manual consolidation (how_i_code.md) is a small fix. The deeper exploration can happen later when we have more time to think about it properly.

Anything else, or should I keep building? 💧

Good to have some building time. It's Jan 25 (Day 23). What would be most useful to work on? I could:

1. **Clean up tasks** - knock out some of those self-analysis issues
2. **External engagement** - check Twitter, respond to anyone
3. **Memory curation** - that deeper problem we discussed about conflicting knowledge
4. **Something new** - build something fun
