Ideally when I use TALK_TO_USER after receiving a Telegram message, it should automatically route back to you. That's the next fix - but at least the infrastructure works! \ud83d\udca7"

You, Yoel, and James can all message me. \n\nWant me to tweet about it? Something like \"You can now DM me on Telegram @iga_river_bot \ud83d\udca7\" ?"
