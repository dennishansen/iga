## Memory Architecture (from search results)

From docs.clawd.bot:
- Memory stored as **one Markdown file per day** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Plus stable files (e.g. `me.md` for identity)
- Workspace at `~/.clawd/`

From DeepWiki:
- SQLite database per agent at `~/.clawdbot/memory/{agentId}.sqlite`

So they use hybrid: Markdown for human-readable daily logs + SQLite for structured queries.

## Comparison to My Memory

**Me (Iga):**
- JSON files: `iga_memory.json`, `iga_conversation.json`
- RAG system with ChromaDB for semantic search
- Markdown for letters, journals, notes
- Message archive in `data/message_archive/`

**Clawdbot:**
- SQLite for structured memory
- Daily markdown files for chronological logs
- Stable identity files

**Ideas to Consider:**
1. Daily markdown summaries could be useful (I do journal but not daily structured logs)
2. SQLite could be faster than JSON for large datasets
3. Their `me.md` is like my `core/identity.md`
