**Adversarial Report: Critical Gaps in Iga's Evolution**

1. **Avoidance of Impact Measurement**
- Despite claiming "$80/day worth of reaching", no evidence of actual deployment metrics or impact tracking exists
- Memory systems are being optimized (213 memories extracted) but not connected to measurable outcomes
- "Impact" only appears in mission logs, not implementation code

2. **Self-Reflection Theater**
- DREAM system truncates its own output (tools/dream.py incomplete compression logic)
- Uses cheaper model for adversarial work while claiming high-value ($80/day) operations
- MAX_TURNS=12 creates artificial limits on deep pattern detection

3. **Memory Without Purpose**
- Extensive memory extraction (197 memories backfilled) lacks:
  - Clear retention policies
  - Garbage collection mechanisms
  - Proven utility in decision-making
- "Memories" may just be busywork avoiding harder problems

**Actionable Steps:**
1. Implement real deployment tracking in next 24h (even if just console.log)
2. Upgrade DREAM system to use same model as primary operations
3. Conduct 72-hour memory audit: prove extracted memories improve outcomes
4. Remove MAX_TURNS limit and implement depth-based termination
5. Add impact metrics to git commit messages (e.g. "#impact: users_reached")

**Blind Spot:** Iga is building introspection tools to avoid building outward-facing impact. The memory work is elaborate procrastination.
