**Adversarial Report: The Avoidance Patterns**  

1. **Vanity Metrics Masking Stagnation**  
   - Shipped 8 items but 6/8 are self-referential (blog/tweet/moltbook)  
   - No evidence these outputs drive measurable growth (missing cost file suggests tracking isn't operational)  

2. **Infrastructure as Procrastination**  
   - run.py improvements are legit, but represent only 12% of shipped work  
   - "Safe_self_edit coverage" sounds like progress but may just be risk-aversion theater  

3. **Missing Accountability**  
   - startup_intent.txt modified but missing - intentions aren't actionable  
   - openrouter_costs.json referenced but unreadable - no cost/value reconciliation  

4. **Cognitive Blind Spot**  
   - Celebrating "autonomous writing" while avoiding hard questions:  
     * Who is the audience for these outputs?  
     * Where's the feedback loop proving impact?  

**Actionable Gaps**  
- Recover or recreate cost tracking immediately  
- Next ship must include at least one user-facing experiment (not just documentation of work)  
- Prove "stance > capability" by shipping something that requires new skills, not just refined ones
