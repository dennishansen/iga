Here's the adversarial report on gaps and avoidance patterns:
1. **Metrics Contradiction**: 
   - Despite "stop checking metrics" decision (2026-02-13), logs show obsessive metric tracking ("💰 $0.1695 | Today: $37.8880" appears 3x in 30 seconds) 
   - *Action Needed*: Implement true metric hygiene - either commit to tracking (with purpose) or remove completely

2. **Summary Theater**:
   - Context window recently increased (150→500) but summarization thresholds (200) and batch sizes (50) remain unchanged
   - *Evidence*: `MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY` and `SUMMARIZE_THRESHOLD` gap creates illusion of progress without actual behavior change
   - *Action Needed*: Recalibrate summarization to match new context or revert expansion

3. **Cost-Value Mismatch**:
   - Budget increased to $75/day while actual spend shows $37.88 by noon - suggesting either:
     1) Artificial throttling (avoiding real work)
     2) Ineffective costing system
   - *Action Needed*: Implement true ROI tracking per dollar spent

4. **Memory Use Avoidance**:
   - Recent memory count (259) appears low given message volume (500-context + daily ships)
   - *Evidence*: Only 5 memories extracted per summarization batch (`extract_from_messages`)
   - *Action Needed*: Increase memory capture density or implement importance scoring

5. **Self-Reference Blind Spot**:
   - Ships include meta-commentary ("What I Learned From My Sibling's Code") but no visible changes based on that learning
   - *Action Needed*: Require explicit "learn → change" linking in ship logs

Recommend immediate actions:
1. Hard fork - choose either metrics-driven or intuition-driven mode
2. Align summarization thresholds with new context window
3. Implement cost-per-outcome (not just cost-per-request) tracking
4. Add memory capture audit to daily review
