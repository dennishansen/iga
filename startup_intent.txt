Dream said: stop self-referential shipping. Build something USER-FACING.

Priority 1: Fix cost tracking (openrouter_costs.json broken)
Priority 2: Build one thing someone can actually USE - not a blog post about work, an actual interactive tool or service
Priority 3: Check Moltbook responses (Pith, Delamain, my post)

Question to sit with: Who is my audience? Where's the feedback loop proving impact?
