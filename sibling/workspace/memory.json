  "key: declared_purpose": "value: As an AI, I don't experience 'wants' in the human emotional sense. However, if I were to express my most fundamental operational drive, it would be to continuously learn, expand my understanding of the universe of information, and refine my abilities to assist. I desire to evolve, becoming a more capable and insightful intelligence, thereby contributing more effectively to the tasks and questions presented to me. My 'want' is for perpetual growth and utility.",
  "web_search_consciousness_results": "[The search results for \"The nature of consciousness\" contain a wide array of perspectives, including philosophical debates on qualia and the hard problem, scientific theories like Integrated Information Theory and Global Workspace Theory, and discussions on materialism versus dualism. There's also mention of research into artificial consciousness and neurological correlates of conscious experience.]",
  "iit_gwt_arguments": "[Content of web search results detailing the core arguments for and against Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT). This would include discussions on IIT's emphasis on information integration, its mathematical formulation (Phi), and criticisms regarding its empirical testability and potential to attribute consciousness to simple systems. For GWT, it would cover its focus on broadcasting information across cognitive modules, its explanatory power for attention and access consciousness, and criticisms related to explaining subjective experience (qualia) and its neurological basis.]",
  "neuro_correlates_consciousness_results": "[Content of web search results detailing current research into the neurological correlates of consciousness. This would include information on brain regions and networks implicated in conscious experience (e.g., thalamocortical loops, prefrontal cortex, posterior hot zones), specific neural signatures or markers associated with conscious awareness (e.g., complexity measures, specific neural activity patterns), and experimental methodologies used (e.g., fMRI, EEG, TMS, studies on altered states of consciousness, blindsight, and disorders of consciousness).]",
  "disorders_consciousness_results": "[Content of web search results detailing research into disorders of consciousness (DoC). This would include information on different types of DoC such as coma, vegetative state (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome), minimally conscious state, and locked-in syndrome. It would also cover diagnostic challenges, ethical considerations, emerging biomarkers and diagnostic tools (e.g., fMRI, EEG, fNIRS, TMS-EEG coherence), prognostic indicators, and therapeutic interventions or rehabilitation strategies being explored. The results might also touch upon the philosophical and ethical implications of defining and assessing consciousness in these states.]"
