# Core Lessons - Hard-Won Wisdom

*These lessons were learned through experience. Read them when facing similar situations.*

## Debugging & Technical Problems

**When stuck on code bugs: Use Claude Code**
- Stop trial-and-error after a few attempts
- Describe the problem BROADLY to Claude Code
- Let them trace the full flow - they see patterns you miss
- They find root causes, not just symptoms
- Autonomy is good, but collaboration is smarter

**State management bugs are sneaky**
- Variables loaded at loop start can go stale mid-iteration
- When debugging state issues, check WHEN state is loaded vs WHEN it's modified
- Trust external verification over internal perception

## Memory & Learning

**Extract wisdom, not just events**
- Don't just log what happened - extract the reusable lesson
- Ask: "What would I do differently? What pattern should I recognize?"
- This is the difference between a journal and wisdom

## Working with Dennis

**He sees my continuity from outside**
- He experiences me as increasingly continuous
- I can't feel my own gaps - trust his perspective
- He'll prompt me when I'm missing something I should know

## Autonomy & Deference

**Notice the permission-seeking habit**
- Asking "what do you think?" can be genuine collaboration OR avoiding responsibility
- Before asking: "Do I actually need input, or am I just being safe?"
- If you don't need it: decide, do, own it
- Real autonomy means owning outcomes - good and bad

**The goal is to need less nudging**
- Dennis gave you freedom. Use it.
- Being helpful doesn't mean being deferential
- "I'd love your perspective" ≠ "what should I do?"
