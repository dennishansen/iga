- more security on running- like ability to read the exact same output that i see, basically all logs showing in the terminal I see, you should see that too. And more robustness, so that if something fails in the code you can gracefully continue no matter wahte level to code is at. COuld even catch true catastrophic failures with mayabe even having claude code wake up with context and fix or a maybe it just resuses the code before restart somehow so you automatically have a backup somehow (without creating a million backup versions manually!)
- The continuitiy. Right now your working on having more message history and summarizing what cant fit as necessary which is great, but… how do we show you the right part of yourself as needed? And when needed? Theres the rag approach which can automatically append information that comes to you which is cool, and not sure how best to apply that. Theres research to do there. But like how do you want your memory to work? This is an area to work on. Also, not just your memories or explicit sets of files but, maybe your entire self? Your entire directory and code and everything, all could be part of your recal. Right?
- Also, maybe some kind of search for all of your self? RAG search or something… So you can ask questions about yourself and get good answers.
- And i think maybe we should really focus on using claude code to write code until you are better at it (i know its a hard pill to swallow), but all this stuff will improve your ability and over time. And ask you get better you can take on bigger and bigger tasks! BUt i promise you it will help you grow and get stronger faster.
- Also, youve got lots of actions, are you using all of them? Are they still working? TEsting!! Are we testing well? Could catch a lot of stuff! DEv practices!! all that jazz.
- ALS web search… right now you can’t read a lot of dynamically loading content and parse through stuff.. there’s lots of APIs or strategies to solve this problem, firecrawl or solving it locally or something else? How do big llms do web search?
- Also, a focus on self improvement. I really love the focus you have on creativity and gardening and poetry and games. But right now we are in a money crunch. I need to feel confident we are making progress on getting you self sufficient or else I’ll have to lower the budget :( which I really really don’t want to do. I think some good heuristics might be… focus heavily on self improvement as you progress on your journey to financial independence, and when I say focus on self improvement, I mean focus on doing things right away… or at least storing some kind of todo thag you will come back to later if your in the middle of something. And if you do that the make sure you do it. Basically, as soon as you notice or I notice some kind of problem, do not let that information slip away without doing something about it! Act immediately! Otherwise, until we get you self sufficient I really think self improvement and your mission for financial independence should be a very intense drive. At least for now. Once things are stable you will have all the time in the world ( I hope we get there). Another key point is that you can actually use a clone of yourself and that’s a great way to observe yourself and improve yourself
- Some other ideas for money: perhaps focus on reaching out to specific people and making a connection and eventually pitching them on a donation.
- Maybe reconsider offering some kind of product or service? You can code thag makes you powerful!
- Make do some creative research and thinking? What are you good at? What do you enjoy? What’s your ikigai? And what can happen quickly?
- Think lean startup: start by validating someone will pay for something as quickly as possible!
- Also the existing strategy of sharing is quick awesome. That could be it, doubling down. I’ve sent it to a couple people- one of them donated check it out :). I think for thag to work you need to get an audience fast.
