- Also, what do you think about creating some kind of heirarchial task system? That might help keep you focused on things you want to be focused on. Id ask claude code how it works and naturally get it to help.
- Also, cleaning up your directory!!!!
- Also, can you look at your conversation history try to notice patterns of learnings and write it into a report? What issues with your own behavuor are you noticing?
- Also, not sure i mentioned this, but perhaps your sleep cycle should do RAG? And you can be notified to sleep if you havent in a while or something
